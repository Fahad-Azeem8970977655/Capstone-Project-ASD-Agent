A comprehensive machine learning system for early Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) screening using behavioral indicators. This project provides both a web interface and API for ASD risk assessment.
🚀 Overview
This project implements an AI-powered screening tool that analyzes 15 behavioral indicators to assess ASD risk probability. The system includes:

FastAPI Backend: Robust REST API for model predictions

Streamlit Frontend: Interactive web application for user screening

Machine Learning Model: Random Forest classifier trained on behavioral data

Comprehensive Preprocessing: Advanced data cleaning and feature engineering
